# LMS-chatbot-service
This service is using llama-index to store files into a Pinecone vector database. 
With langchain, an agent is created to retrieve documents from the index and answer the user's questions based on the retrieved documents.
It acts like a tutor of the lecture DBIS.

The service is connected to the SBF and Moodle.
